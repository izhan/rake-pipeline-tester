Rake Pipeline Test
====================

This is a simple [rake pipeline](https://github.com/livingsocial/rake-pipeline) that tests a [ES6 Module Transpiler filter](https://github.com/izhan/rake-pipeline-web-filters) that I recently created.

The filter itself depends on the [ruby_es6_module_transpiler](https://github.com/izhan/ruby_es6_module_transpiler) gem.  You should have Node.js available as well.
